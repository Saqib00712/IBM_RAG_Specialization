# # **Build Smarter AI Apps: Empower LLMs with LangChain**
# 

# Estimated time needed: **60** minutes 
# 

# ## Overview
# 

# LangChain is an open-source framework designed to develop applications that leverage large language models (LLMs). LangChain stands out by providing essential tools and abstractions that enhance the customization, accuracy, and relevance of the information generated by these models.
# 
# LangChain offers a generic interface compatible with nearly any LLM. This generic interface facilitates a centralized development environment so that data scientists can seamlessly integrate LLM-powered applications with external data sources and software workflows. This integration is crucial for organizations looking to harness AI's full potential in their processes.
# 
# One of LangChain's most powerful features is its module-based approach. This approach supports flexibility when performing experiments and the optimization of interactions with LLMs. Data scientists can dynamically compare prompts and switch between foundation models without significant code modifications. These capabilities save valuable development time and enhance the developer's ability to fine-tune applications.

# ## Objectives
# 
# After completing this lab, you will be able to:
# 
# - Use the core features of the LangChain framework, including prompt templates, chains, and agents, relative to enhancing LLM customization and output relevance.
# 
# - Explore LangChain's modular approach, which supports dynamic adjustments to prompts and models without extensive code changes.
# 
# - Enhance LLM applications by integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques with LangChain. You'll learn how integrating RAG enables greater accuracy and delivers improved contextually-aware responses.
# 

# ## Setup
# 

# For this lab, you will use the following libraries:
# 
# *   [`ibm-watson-ai`, `ibm-watson-machine-learning`](https://ibm.github.io/watson-machine-learning-sdk/index.html) for using LLMs from IBM's watsonx.ai.
# *   [`langchain`, `langchain-ibm`, `langchain-community`, `langchain-experimental`](https://www.langchain.com/) for using relevant features from LangChain.
# *   [`pypdf`](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) is an open-source pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files.
# *   [`chromadb`](https://www.trychroma.com/) is an open-source vector database used to store embeddings.
# 

# ### Installing required libraries
# 
# The following required libraries are **not** pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment. **You must run the code in the following cell** to install them:
# 
# **Note:** The required library versions are specified and pinned here. It's recommended that you also pin tis library information. Even if these libraries are updated in the future, these installed library versions will still support this lab work.
# 
# The installation might take approximately 2-3 minutes.
# 
# Because you are using `%%capture`  to capture the installation process, you won't see the output. However, after the installation is complete, you will see a number beside the cell.
# 

# In[3]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('capture', '', '!pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir tenacity==8.2.3 --user\n!pip install "ibm-watsonx-ai==1.0.8" --user\n!pip install "ibm-watson-machine-learning==1.0.367" --user\n!pip install "langchain-ibm==0.1.7" --user\n!pip install "langchain-community==0.2.10" --user\n!pip install "langchain-experimental==0.0.62" --user\n!pip install "langchainhub==0.1.18" --user\n!pip install "langchain==0.2.11" --user\n!pip install "pypdf==4.2.0" --user\n!pip install "chromadb==0.4.24" --user\n')

from ibm_watsonx_ai.foundation_models import ModelInference
from ibm_watsonx_ai.metanames import GenTextParamsMetaNames as GenParams
from ibm_watsonx_ai.foundation_models.utils.enums import ModelTypes
from ibm_watson_machine_learning.foundation_models.extensions.langchain import WatsonxLLM


# ## LangChain concepts
# 

# ### Model
# 

# A large language model (LLM) serves as the interface for the AI's capabilities. The LLM processes plain text input and generates text output, forming the core functionality needed to complete various tasks. When integrated with LangChain, the LLM becomes a powerful tool, providing the foundational structure necessary for building and deploying sophisticated AI applications.
# 

# ## API Disclaimer
# This lab uses LLMs provided by **Watsonx.ai**. This environment has been configured to allow LLM use without API keys so you can prompt them for **free (with limitations)**. With that in mind, if you wish to run this notebook **locally outside** of Skills Network's JupyterLab environment, you will have to **configure your own API keys**. Please note that using your own API keys means that you will incur personal charges.
# 
# ### Running Locally
# If you are running this lab locally, you will need to configure your own API keys. This lab uses the `ModelInference` module from `IBM`. To configure your own API key, run the code cell below with your key in the `api_key` field of `credentials`. **DO NOT** uncomment the `api_key` field if you aren't running locally, it will causes errors.
# 

# The following code will construct a `meta-llama/llama-3-3-70b-instruct` watsonx.ai inference model object:
# 

# In[2]:


model_id = 'meta-llama/llama-3-3-70b-instruct' 

parameters = {
    GenParams.MAX_NEW_TOKENS: 256,  # this controls the maximum number of tokens in the generated output
    GenParams.TEMPERATURE: 0.2, # this randomness or creativity of the model's responses 
}

credentials = {
    "url": "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com"
    # "api_key": "your api key here"
    # uncomment above and fill in the API key when running locally
}

project_id = "skills-network"

model = ModelInference(
    model_id=model_id,
    params=parameters,
    credentials=credentials,
    project_id=project_id
)


# Let's use a simple example to let the model generate some text:
# 

# In[3]:


msg = model.generate("In today's sales meeting, we ")
print(msg['results'][0]['generated_text']) 


# ### Chat model
# 

# Chat models support assigning distinct roles to conversation messages, helping to distinguish messages from AI, users, and instructions such as system messages.
# 

# To enable the LLM from watsonx.ai to work with LangChain, you need to wrap the LLM using `WatsonLLM()`. This wrapper converts the LLM into a chat model, which allows the LLM to integrate seamlessly with LangChain's framework for creating interactive and dynamic AI applications.
# 

# In[4]:


llama_llm = WatsonxLLM(model = model)


# The following provides an example of an interaction with a `WatsonLLM()`-wrapped model:
# 

# In[5]:


print(llama_llm.invoke("Who is man's best friend?"))


# ### Chat message
# 

# The chat model takes a list of messages as input and returns a new message. All messages have both a role and a content property.  Here's a list of the most commonly used types of messages:
# 
# - `SystemMessage`: Use this message type to prime AI behavior.  This message type is  usually passed in as the first in a sequence of input messages.
# - `HumanMessage`: This message type represents a message from a person interacting with the chat model.
# - `AIMessage`: This message type, which can be either text or a request to invoke a tool, represents a message from the chat model.
# 
# You can find more message types at [LangChain built-in message types](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/custom_chat_model/#messages).
# 

# The following code imports the most common message type classes from LangChain:
# 

# In[6]:


from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage, AIMessage


# Now let's create a few messages that simulate a chat experience with the bot:
# 

# In[7]:


msg = llama_llm.invoke(
    [
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful AI bot that assists a user in choosing the perfect book to read in one short sentence"),
        HumanMessage(content="I enjoy mystery novels, what should I read?")
    ]
)


# In[8]:


print(msg)


# Notice that the model responded with an `AI` message.
# 

# You can use these message types to pass an entire chat history along with the AI's responses to the model:
# 

# In[9]:


msg = llama_llm.invoke(
    [
        SystemMessage(content="You are a supportive AI bot that suggests fitness activities to a user in one short sentence"),
        HumanMessage(content="I like high-intensity workouts, what should I do?"),
        AIMessage(content="You should try a CrossFit class"),
        HumanMessage(content="How often should I attend?")
    ]
)


# In[10]:


print(msg)


# You can also exclude the system message.
# 

# In[11]:


msg = llama_llm.invoke(
    [
        HumanMessage(content="What month follows June?")
    ]
)


# In[12]:


print(msg)


# ### Exercise 1 
# #### **Compare Model Responses with Different Parameters**
# 
# Watsonx.ai provides access to several foundational models. In the previous section you used `meta-llama/llama-3-3-70b-instruct`. Try using another foundational model, such as `ibm/granite-3-3-8b-instruct`.
# 
# 
# **Instructions**:
# 
# 1. Create two instances, one instance for the Granite model and one instance for the Llama model. You can also adjust each model's creativity with different temperature settings.
# 2. Send identical prompts to each model and compare the responses.
# 3. Try at least 3 different types of prompts.
# 
# Check out these prompt types:
# 
# | Prompt type |   Prompt Example  |
# |------------------- |--------------------------|
# | **Creative writing**  | "Write a short poem about artificial intelligence." |
# | **Factual questions** |  "What are the key components of a neural network?"  |
# | **Instruction-following**  | "List 5 tips for effective time management." |
# 
# Then document your observations on how temperature affects:
# 
# - Creativity compared to consistency
# - Variation between multiple runs
# - Appropriateness for different tasks
# 
# 
# 
# 

# **Starter code: provide your solution in the TODO parts**
# 

# In[13]:

    GenParams.MAX_NEW_TOKENS: 256,
    GenParams.TEMPERATURE: 0.8,  # Higher temperature for more creative responses

)

    "Write a short poem about artificial intelligence",
    "What are the key components of a neural network?",
    "List 5 tips for effective time management"

    print("\nGranite Creative response (Temperature = 0.8):")
    print(granite_llm_creative.invoke(prompt))
    print("\nLlama Creative response (Temperature = 0.8):")

# ### Prompt templates
# 

# Prompt templates help translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. You can use prompt templates to guide a model's response, helping the model understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output.
# 
# Next, explore several different types of prompt templates.
# 

# #### String prompt templates
# 

# Use these prompt templates to format a single string. These templates are generally used for simpler inputs.
# 

# In[15]:


from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate


# Then, create a prompt template with variables for customization. We also create a dictionary to store inputs that will replace the placeholders. The keys match the variable names in the template, and values are what will be inserted.
# 

# In[16]:


prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me one {adjective} joke about {topic}")
input_ = {"adjective": "funny", "topic": "cats"}  # create a dictionary to store the corresponding input to placeholders in prompt template


# Finally, format the prompt template with the input dictionary. The code below invokes the prompt with our input values, replacing {adjective} with "funny" and {topic} with "cats". The result will be a formatted string: "Tell me one funny joke about cats".
# 

# In[17]:


prompt.invoke(input_)


# Note the formatting for each prompt.
# 

# #### Chat prompt templates
# 

# You can use these prompt templates to format a list of messages. These "templates" consist of lists of templates.
# 

# In[18]:


# Import the ChatPromptTemplate class from langchain_core.prompts module
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Create a ChatPromptTemplate with a list of message tuples
# Each tuple contains a role ("system" or "user") and the message content
# The system message sets the behavior of the assistant
# The user message includes a variable placeholder {topic} that will be replaced later
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
 ("system", "You are a helpful assistant"),
 ("user", "Tell me a joke about {topic}")
])

# Create a dictionary with the variable to be inserted into the template
# The key "topic" matches the placeholder name in the user message
input_ = {"topic": "cats"}

# Format the chat template with our input values
# This replaces {topic} with "cats" in the user message
# The result will be a formatted chat message structure ready to be sent to a model
prompt.invoke(input_)


# ####  MessagesPlaceholder
# 

# You can use the MessagesPlaceholder prompt template to add a list of messages in a specific location. In `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages`, you saw how to format two messages, with each message as a string. But what if you want the user to supply a list of messages that you would slot into a particular spot? You can use `MessagesPlaceholder` for this task.
# 

# In[19]:


# Import MessagesPlaceholder for including multiple messages in a template
from langchain_core.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder
# Import HumanMessage for creating message objects with specific roles
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Create a ChatPromptTemplate with a system message and a placeholder for multiple messages
# The system message sets the behavior for the assistant
# MessagesPlaceholder allows for inserting multiple messages at once into the template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
("system", "You are a helpful assistant"),
MessagesPlaceholder("msgs")  # This will be replaced with one or more messages
])

# Create an input dictionary where the key matches the MessagesPlaceholder name
# The value is a list of message objects that will replace the placeholder
# Here we're adding a single HumanMessage asking about the day after Tuesday
input_ = {"msgs": [HumanMessage(content="What is the day after Tuesday?")]}

# Format the chat template with our input dictionary
# This replaces the MessagesPlaceholder with the HumanMessage in our input
# The result will be a formatted chat structure with a system message and our human message
prompt.invoke(input_)


# You can wrap the prompt and the chat model and pass them into a chain, which can invoke the message.
# 

# In[20]:


chain = prompt | llama_llm
response = chain.invoke(input = input_)
print(response)


# ### Output parsers
# 

# Output parsers take the output from an LLM and transform that output to a more suitable format. Parsing the output is very useful when you are using LLMs to generate any form of structured data, or to normalize output from chat models and other LLMs.
# 

# LangChain has lots of different types of output parsers. This is a [list](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#output-parsers) of output parsers LangChain supports. In this lab, you will use the following two output parsers as examples:
# 
# - `JSON`: Returns a JSON object as specified. You can specify a Pydantic model and it will return JSON for that model. Probably the most reliable output parser for getting structured data that does NOT use function calling.
# - `CSV`: Returns a list of comma separated values.
# 

# #### JSON parser
# 

# This output parser allows users to specify an arbitrary JSON schema and query LLMs for outputs that conform to that schema.
# 

# In[21]:


# Import the JsonOutputParser from langchain_core to convert LLM responses into structured JSON
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser
# Import BaseModel and Field from langchain_core's pydantic_v1 module
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field


# In[22]:


# Define your desired data structure.
class Joke(BaseModel):
    setup: str = Field(description="question to set up a joke")
    punchline: str = Field(description="answer to resolve the joke")


# In[23]:


# And a query intended to prompt a language model to populate the data structure.
joke_query = "Tell me a joke."

# Set up a parser + inject instructions into the prompt template.
output_parser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object=Joke)

# Get the formatting instructions for the output parser
# This generates guidance text that tells the LLM how to format its response
format_instructions = output_parser.get_format_instructions()

# Create a prompt template that includes:
# 1. Instructions for the LLM to answer the user's query
# 2. Format instructions to ensure the LLM returns properly structured data
# 3. The actual user query placeholder
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="Answer the user query.\n{format_instructions}\n{query}\n",
    input_variables=["query"],  # Dynamic variables that will be provided when invoking the chain
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": format_instructions},  # Static variables set once when creating the prompt
)

# Create a processing chain that:
# 1. Formats the prompt using the template
# 2. Sends the formatted prompt to the Llama LLM
# 3. Parses the LLM's response using the output parser to extract structured data
chain = prompt | llama_llm | output_parser

# Invoke the chain with a specific query about jokes
# This will:
# 1. Format the prompt with the joke query
# 2. Send it to Llama
# 3. Parse the response into the structure defined by your output parser
# 4. Return the structured result
chain.invoke({"query": joke_query})


# #### Comma-separated list parser
# 

# Use the comma-separated list parser when you want a list of comma-separated items.
# 

# In[24]:


# Import the CommaSeparatedListOutputParser to parse LLM responses into Python lists
from langchain.output_parsers import CommaSeparatedListOutputParser

# Create an instance of the parser that will convert comma-separated text into a Python list
output_parser = CommaSeparatedListOutputParser()

# Get formatting instructions that will tell the LLM how to structure its response
# These instructions explain to the LLM that it should return items in a comma-separated format
format_instructions = output_parser.get_format_instructions()

# Create a prompt template that:
# 1. Instructs the LLM to answer the user query
# 2. Includes format instructions so the LLM knows to respond with comma-separated values
# 3. Asks the LLM to list five items of the specified subject
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="Answer the user query. {format_instructions}\nList five {subject}.",
    input_variables=["subject"],  # This variable will be provided when the chain is invoked
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": format_instructions},  # This variable is set once when creating the prompt
)

# Build a processing chain that:
# 1. Takes the subject and formats it into the prompt template
# 2. Sends the formatted prompt to the Llama LLM
# 3. Parses the LLM's response into a Python list using the CommaSeparatedListOutputParser
chain = prompt | llama_llm | output_parser

# Invoke the processing chain with "ice cream flavors" as the subject
# This will:
# 1. Substitute "ice cream flavors" into the prompt template
# 2. Send the formatted prompt to the Llama LLM
# 3. Parse the LLM's comma-separated response into a Python list
chain.invoke({"subject": "ice cream flavors"})


# ### Exercise 2 
# #### **Creating and Using a JSON Output Parser**
# 
# Now let's implement a simple JSON output parser to structure the responses from your LLM.
# 
# **Instructions:**  
# 
# You'll complete the following steps:
# 
# 1. Import the necessary components to create a JSON output parser.
# 2. Create a prompt template that requests information in JSON format (hint: use the provided template).
# 3. Build a chain that connects your prompt, LLM, and JSON parser.
# 4. Test your parser using at least three different inputs.
# 5. Access and display specific fields from the parsed JSON output.
# 6. Verify that your output is properly structured and accessible as a Python dictionary.

# ### Documents
# 

# #### Document object
# 

# A `Document` object in `LangChain` contains information about some data. A Document object has the following two attributes:
# 
# - `page_content`: *`str`*: This attribute holds the content of the document\.
# - `metadata`: *`dict`*: This attribute contains arbitrary metadata associated with the document. You can use the metadata to track various details, such as the document ID, the file name, and other details.
# 

# Let's examine how to create a `Document` object. `LangChain` uses the  `Document` object type to handle text or documents.
# 

# In[26]:


# Import the Document class from langchain_core.documents module
# Document is a container for text content with associated metadata
from langchain_core.documents import Document

# Create a Document instance with:
# 1. page_content: The actual text content about Python
# 2. metadata: A dictionary containing additional information about this document
Document(page_content="""Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
 Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.""",
metadata={
    'my_document_id' : 234234,                      # Unique identifier for this document
    'my_document_source' : "About Python",          # Source or title information
    'my_document_create_time' : 1680013019          # Unix timestamp for document creation (March 28, 2023)
 })


# Note that you don't have to include metadata.
# 

# In[27]:


Document(page_content="""Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. 
                        Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.""")


# #### Document loaders
# 

# Document loaders in LangChain are designed to load documents from a variety of sources; for instance, loading a PDF file and having the LLM read the PDF file using LangChain.
# 
# LangChain offers over 100 distinct document loaders, along with integrations with other major providers, such as AirByte and Unstructured. These integrations enable loading of all kinds of documents (HTML, PDF, code) from various locations including private Amazon S3 buckets, as well as from public websites).
# 
# You can find a list of document types that LangChain can load at [LangChain Document loaders](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/document_loaders/).
# 
# In this lab, you will use the PDF loader and the URL and website loader.
# 

# ##### **PDF loader**
# 

# By using the PDF loader, you can load a PDF file as a `Document` object.
# 
# In this example, you will load the following paper about using LangChain. You can access and read the paper here: [Revolutionizing Mental Health Care through LangChain: A Journey with a Large Language Model](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.05568).
# 

# In[28]:


# Import the PyPDFLoader class from langchain_community's document_loaders module
# This loader is specifically designed to load and parse PDF files
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

# Create a PyPDFLoader instance by passing the URL of the PDF file
# The loader will download the PDF from the specified URL and prepare it for loading
loader = PyPDFLoader("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/96-FDF8f7coh0ooim7NyEQ/langchain-paper.pdf")

# Call the load() method to:
# 1. Download the PDF if needed
# 2. Extract text from each page
# 3. Create a list of Document objects, one for each page of the PDF
# Each Document will contain the text content of a page and metadata including page number
document = loader.load()


# Here, `document` is a `Document` object with `page_content` and `metadata`:
# 

# In[29]:


document[2]  # take a look at the page 2


# In[30]:


print(document[1].page_content[:1000])  # print the page 1's first 1000 tokens


# ##### **URL and website loader**
# 

# You can also load content from a URL or website into a `Document` object:
# 

# In[31]:


# Import the WebBaseLoader class from langchain_community's document_loaders module
# This loader is designed to scrape and extract text content from web pages
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader

# Create a WebBaseLoader instance by passing the URL of the web page to load
# This URL points to the LangChain documentation's introduction page
loader = WebBaseLoader("https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/")

# Call the load() method to:
# 1. Send an HTTP request to the specified URL
# 2. Download the HTML content
# 3. Parse the HTML to extract meaningful text
# 4. Create a list of Document objects containing the extracted content
web_data = loader.load()

# Print the first 1000 characters of the page content from the first Document
# This provides a preview of the successfully loaded web content
# web_data[0] accesses the first Document in the list
# .page_content accesses the text content of that Document
# [:1000] slices the string to get only the first 1000 characters
print(web_data[0].page_content[:1000])


# #### Text splitters
# 

# After you load documents, you will often want to transform those documents to better suit your application.
# 

# One of the most simple examples of making documents better suit your application is to split a long document into smaller chunks that can fit into your model's context window. LangChain has built-in document transformers that ease the process of splitting, combining, filtering, and otherwise manipulating documents.
# 
# At a high level, here is how text splitters work:
# 
# 1. They split the text into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).
# 2. They start combining these small chunks of text into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by a specific function).
# 3. After the combined text reaches the new chunk's size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap to keep context between chunks.
# 
# For a list of types of text splitters LangChain supports, see [LangChain Text Splitters](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/).
# 

# Let's use a simple `CharacterTextSplitter` as an example of how to split the LangChain paper you just loaded.
# 
# This is the simplest method. This splits based on characters (by default "\n\n") and measures chunk length by number of characters.
# 
# `CharacterTextSplitter` is the simplest method of splitting the content. These splits are based on characters (by default "\n\n") and measures chunk length by number of characters.
# 

# In[32]:


# Import the CharacterTextSplitter class from langchain.text_splitter module
# Text splitters are used to divide large texts into smaller, manageable chunks
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

# Create a CharacterTextSplitter with specific configuration:
# - chunk_size=200: Each chunk will contain approximately 200 characters
# - chunk_overlap=20: Consecutive chunks will overlap by 20 characters to maintain context
# - separator="\n": Text will be split at newline characters when possible
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=200, chunk_overlap=20, separator="\n")

# Split the previously loaded document (PDF or other text) into chunks
# The split_documents method:
# 1. Takes a list of Document objects
# 2. Splits each document's content based on the configured parameters
# 3. Returns a new list of Document objects where each contains a chunk of text
# 4. Preserves the original metadata for each chunk
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(document)

# Print the total number of chunks created
# This shows how many smaller Document objects were generated from the original document(s)
# The number depends on the original document length and the chunk_size setting
print(len(chunks))


# The CharacterTextSplitter splits the document into 148 chunks. Let's look at the content of a chunk:
# 

# In[33]:


chunks[5].page_content   # take a look at any chunk's page content


# ### Exercise 3
# #### Working with Document Loaders and Text Splitters
# 
# You now know about about Document objects and how to load content from different sources. Now, let's implement a workflow to load documents, split them, and prepare them for retrieval.
# 
# **Instructions:**
# 
# 1. Import the necessary document loaders to work with both PDF and web content.
# 2. Load the provided paper about LangChain architecture.
# 3. Create two different text splitters with varying parameters.
# 4. Compare the resulting chunks from different splitters.
# 5. Examine the metadata preservation across splitting.
# 6. Create a simple function to display statistics about your document chunks.

# #### Embedding models
# 

# Embedding models are specifically designed to interface with text embeddings.
# 
# Embeddings generate a vector representation for a specified piece or "chunk" of text.  Embeddings offer the advantage of allowing you to conceptualize text within a vector space. Consequently, you can perform operations such as semantic search, where you identify pieces of text that are most similar within the vector space.
# 

# IBM, OpenAI, Hugging Face, and others offer embedding models. Here, you will use the embedding model from IBM's watsonx.ai to work with the text.
# 

# In[36]:


# Import the EmbedTextParamsMetaNames class from ibm_watsonx_ai.metanames module
# This class provides constants for configuring Watson embedding parameters
from ibm_watsonx_ai.metanames import EmbedTextParamsMetaNames

# - url: The endpoint URL for the Watson service in the US South region
# - project_id: The Watson project ID to use ("skills-network")
# - params: The embedding parameters configured earlier
watsonx_embedding = WatsonxEmbeddings(
    model_id="ibm/slate-125m-english-rtrvr",
    url="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
    project_id="skills-network",
    params=embed_params,
)


# The following code embeds content in each of the chunks. You can then output the first 5 numbers in the vector representation of the content of the first chunk.
# 

# In[38]:


texts = [text.page_content for text in chunks]

embedding_result = watsonx_embedding.embed_documents(texts)
embedding_result[0][:5]


# #### Vector stores
# 

# One of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is to embed the text data and store the resulting embedding vectors, and then at query time to embed the unstructured query and retrieve the embedding vectors that are 'most similar' to the embedded query. You can use a [vector store](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) to store embedded data and perform vector search for you.
# 

# You can find many vector store options. Here, the code uses `Chroma`.
# 

# In[39]:


from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma


# Next, have the embedding model perform the embedding process and store the resulting vectors in the Chroma vector database.
# 
# **NOTE**: You can safely ignore the warnings related to telemetry events. They are related to ChromaDB's telemetry collection system and do not affect the functionality of your code. Your vector search and similarity operations will work correctly despite these messages.
# 

# In[40]:


docsearch = Chroma.from_documents(chunks, watsonx_embedding)


# Then you can use a similarity search strategy to retrieve the information that is related to your query. The model returns a list of similar or relevant document chunks. Here, you can view the code that prints the contents of the most similar chunk.
# 

# In[41]:


query = "Langchain"
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)


# #### Retrievers
# 

# A retriever is an interface that returns documents using an unstructured query. Retrievers are more general than a vector store. A retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) them. You can still use vector stores as the backbone of a retriever. Note that other types of retrievers also exist.
# 
# Retrievers accept a string `query` as input and return a list of `Documents` as output.
# 
# You can view a list of the advanced retrieval types LangChain supports at [https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/)
# 
# 

# A list of advanced retrieval types LangChain could support is available at [https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). Let's introduce the `Vector store-backed retriever` and `Parent document retriever` as examples.
# 

# ##### **Vector store-backed retrievers**
# 

# Vector store retrievers are retrievers that use a vector store to retrieve documents. They are a lightweight wrapper around the vector store class to make it conform to the retriever interface. They use the search methods implemented by a vector store, such as similarity search and MMR (Maximum marginal relevance), to query the texts in the vector store.
# 
# Now that you have constructed a vector store `docsearch`, you can easily construct a retriever such as seen in the following code.
# 

# In[42]:


# Use the docsearch vector store as a retriever
# This converts the vector store into a retriever interface that can fetch relevant documents
retriever = docsearch.as_retriever()

# Invoke the retriever with the query "Langchain"
# This will:
# 1. Convert the query text "Langchain" into an embedding vector
# 2. Perform a similarity search in the vector store using this embedding
# 3. Return the most semantically similar documents to the query
docs = retriever.invoke("Langchain")

# Access the first (most relevant) document from the retrieval results
# This returns the full Document object including:
# - page_content: The text content of the document
# - metadata: Any associated metadata like source, page numbers, etc.
# The returned document is the one most semantically similar to "Langchain"
docs[0]


# Note that the results are identical to the results you obtained using the similarity search strategy.
# 

# ##### **Parent document retrievers**
# 

# When splitting documents for retrieval, there are often conflicting goals:
# 
# - You want small documents so their embeddings can most accurately reflect their meaning. If the documents are too long, then the embeddings can lose meaning.
# - You want to have long enough documents to retain the context of each chunk of text.
# 
# The `ParentDocumentRetriever` strikes that balance by splitting and storing small chunks of data. During retrieval, this retriever first fetches the small chunks, but then looks up the parent IDs for the data and returns those larger documents.
# 
# 

# In[43]:


from langchain.retrievers import ParentDocumentRetriever
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.storage import InMemoryStore


# In[44]:


# Set up two different text splitters for a hierarchical splitting approach:

# 1. Parent splitter creates larger chunks (2000 characters)
# This is used to split documents into larger, more contextually complete sections
parent_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=20, separator='\n')

# 2. Child splitter creates smaller chunks (400 characters)
# This is used to split the parent chunks into smaller pieces for more precise retrieval
child_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=400, chunk_overlap=20, separator='\n')

# Create a Chroma vector store with:
# - A specific collection name "split_parents" for organization
# - The previously configured Watson embeddings function
vectorstore = Chroma(
    collection_name="split_parents", embedding_function=watsonx_embedding
)

# Set up an in-memory storage layer for the parent documents
# This will store the larger chunks that provide context, but won't be directly embedded
store = InMemoryStore()


# In[45]:


# Create a ParentDocumentRetriever instance that implements hierarchical document retrieval
retriever = ParentDocumentRetriever(
    # The vector store where child document embeddings will be stored and searched
    # This Chroma instance will contain the embeddings for the smaller chunks
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    
    # The document store where parent documents will be stored
    # These larger chunks won't be embedded but will be retrieved by ID when needed
    docstore=store,
    
    # The splitter used to create small chunks (400 chars) for precise vector search
    # These smaller chunks are embedded and used for similarity matching
    child_splitter=child_splitter,
    
    # The splitter used to create larger chunks (2000 chars) for better context
    # These parent chunks provide more complete information when retrieved
    parent_splitter=parent_splitter,
)


# Then, we add documents to the hierarchical retrieval system:
# 

# In[46]:


retriever.add_documents(document)


# The following code retrieves and counts the number of parent document IDs stored in the document store
# 

# In[47]:


len(list(store.yield_keys()))


# Next, we verify that the underlying vector store still retrieves the small chunks.
# 

# In[48]:


sub_docs = vectorstore.similarity_search("Langchain")


# In[49]:


print(sub_docs[0].page_content)


# And then retrieve the relevant large chunk.
# 

# In[50]:


retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke("Langchain")


# In[51]:


print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content)


# ##### **RetrievalQA**
# 

# Now that you understand how to retrieve information from a document, you might be interested in exploring some more exciting applications. For instance, you could have the Language Model (LLM) read the paper and summarize it for you, or create a QA bot that can answer your questions based on the paper.
# 
# Here's an example using LangChain's `RetrievalQA`.
# 

# In[52]:


from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA


# In[53]:


# Create a RetrievalQA chain by configuring:
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    # The language model to use for generating answers
    llm=llama_llm,
    
    # The chain type "stuff" means all retrieved documents are simply concatenated and passed to the LLM
    chain_type="stuff",
    
    # The retriever component that will fetch relevant documents
    # docsearch.as_retriever() converts the vector store into a retriever interface
    retriever=docsearch.as_retriever(),
    
    # Whether to include the source documents in the response
    # Set to False to return only the generated answer
    return_source_documents=False
)

# Define a query to test the QA system
# This question asks about the main topic of the paper
query = "what is this paper discussing?"

# Execute the QA chain with the query
# This will:
# 1. Send the query to the retriever to get relevant documents
# 2. Combine those documents using the "stuff" method
# 3. Send the query and combined documents to the Llama LLM
# 4. Return the generated answer (without source documents)
qa.invoke(query)


# ### Exercise 4

# ### Memory
# 

# Most LLM applications have a conversational interface. An essential component of a conversation is being able to refer to information introduced earlier in the conversation. At a bare minimum, a conversational system should be able to directly access some window of past messages.
# 

# #### Chat message history
# 

# One of the core utility classes underpinning most (if not all) memory modules is the `ChatMessageHistory` class. This class is a super lightweight wrapper that provides convenience methods for saving `HumanMessages` and `AIMessages`, and then fetching both types of messages.
# 
# Here is an example.
# 

# In[56]:


# Import the ChatMessageHistory class from langchain.memory
from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory

# Set up the language model to use for chat interactions
chat = llama_llm

# Create a new conversation history object
# This will store the back-and-forth messages in the conversation
history = ChatMessageHistory()

# Add an initial greeting message from the AI to the history
# This represents a message that would have been sent by the AI assistant
history.add_ai_message("hi!")

# Add a user's question to the conversation history
# This represents a message sent by the user
history.add_user_message("what is the capital of France?")


# Let's have a look at the messages in the history:
# 

# In[57]:


history.messages


# You can pass these messages in history to the model to generate a response. The code below is retrieving all messages from the ChatMessageHistory object and passing them to the Llama LLM to generate a contextually appropriate response based on the conversation history.
# 

# In[58]:


ai_response = chat.invoke(history.messages)
ai_response


# You can see the model gives a correct response.
# 

# Let's look again at the messages in history. Note that the history now includes the AI's message, which has been appended to the message history:
# 

# In[59]:


history.add_ai_message(ai_response)
history.messages


# #### Conversation buffer
# 

# Conversation buffer memory allows for the storage of messages, which you use to extract messages to a variable. Consider using conversation buffer memory in a chain, setting `verbose=True` so that the prompt is visible.
# 

# In[60]:


# Import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.memory module
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

# Import ConversationChain from langchain.chains module
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

# Create a conversation chain with the following components:
conversation = ConversationChain(
    # The language model to use for generating responses
    llm=llama_llm,
    
    # Set verbose to True to see the full prompt sent to the LLM, including memory contents
    verbose=True,
    
    # Initialize with ConversationBufferMemory that will:
    # - Store all conversation turns (user inputs and AI responses)
    # - Append the entire conversation history to each new prompt
    # - Provide context for the LLM to generate contextually relevant responses
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)


# Let’s begin the conversation by introducing the user as a little cat and proceed by incorporating some additional messages. Finally, prompt the model to check if it can recall that the user is a little cat.
# 

# In[61]:


conversation.invoke(input="Hello, I am a little cat. Who are you?")


# In[62]:


conversation.invoke(input="What can you do?")


# In[63]:


conversation.invoke(input="Who am I?.")


# As you can see, the model remembers that the user is a little cat. You can see this in both the `history` and the `response` keys in the dictionary returned by the `conversation.invoke()` method.
# 

# ### Exercise 5
# #### **Building a Chatbot with Memory using LangChain**
# 
# In this exercise, you'll create a simple chatbot that can remember previous interactions using LangChain's memory components. You'll implement conversation memory to make your chatbot maintain context throughout a conversation.
# 
# **Instructions:**
# 
# 1. Import the necessary components for chat history and conversation memory.
# 2. Set up a language model for your chatbot.
# 3. Create a conversation chain with memory capabilities.

# ### Chains
# 

# `Chains` are one of the most powerful features in LangChain, allowing you to combine multiple components into cohesive workflows. This section presents two different methodologies for implementing chains - the traditional `SequentialChain` approach and the newer LangChain Expression Language (`LCEL`).
# 
# **Why Chains Matter:**
# 
# Chains solve a fundamental problem with LLMs. Chains are primarily designed to handle a single prompt and generate a single response. However, most real-world applications require multi-step reasoning, accessing different tools, or breaking complex tasks into manageable pieces. Chains allow you to orchestrate these complex workflows.
# 
# **Evolution of Chain Patterns:**
# 
# Traditional chains (`LLMChain`, `SequentialChain`) were LangChain's first implementation, offering a structured but somewhat rigid approach. LCEL (using the pipe operator `|`) represents a more flexible, functional approach that's easier to compose and debug.
# 
# **Note:** While both approaches are presented here for educational purposes, **LCEL is the recommended pattern for new development.** The SequentialChain approach continues to be supported for backward compatibility, but the LangChain community has largely transitioned to the LCEL pattern for its superior flexibility and expressiveness.
# 

# #### **Simple Chain**
# 

# #### Traditional Approach: LLMChain
# 

# Here is a simple single chain using `LLMChain`.
# 

# In[66]:


# Import the LLMChain class from langchain.chains module
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# Create a template string for generating recommendations of classic dishes from a given location
# The template includes:
# - Instructions for the task (recommending a classic dish)
# - A placeholder {location} that will be replaced with user input
# - A format indicator for the expected response
template = """Your job is to come up with a classic dish from the area that the users suggests.
{location}
 YOUR RESPONSE:
"""

# Create a PromptTemplate object by providing:
# - The template string defined above
# - A list of input variables that will be used to format the template
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=['location'])

# Create an LLMChain that connects:
# - The Llama language model (llama_llm)
# - The prompt template configured for location-based dish recommendations
# - An output_key 'meal' that specifies the key name for the chain's response in the output dictionary
location_chain = LLMChain(llm=llama_llm, prompt=prompt_template, output_key='meal')

# Invoke the chain with 'China' as the location input
# This will:
# 1. Format the template with {location: 'China'}
# 2. Send the formatted prompt to the Llama LLM
# 3. Return a dictionary with the response under the key 'meal'
location_chain.invoke(input={'location':'China'})


# #### Modern Approach: LCEL
# 
# Here is the same chain implemented using the more modern LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) approach with the pipe operator:
# 

# In[67]:


# Import PromptTemplate from langchain_core.prompts
# This is the new import path in LangChain's modular structure
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Import StrOutputParser from langchain_core.output_parsers
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

template = """Your job is to come up with a classic dish from the area that the users suggests.
{location}
 YOUR RESPONSE:
"""

# Create a prompt template using the from_template method
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

# Create a chain using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) with the pipe operator
# This creates a processing pipeline that:
# 1. Formats the prompt with the input values
# 2. Sends the formatted prompt to the Llama LLM
# 3. Parses the output to extract just the string response
location_chain_lcel = prompt | llama_llm | StrOutputParser()

# Invoke the chain with 'China' as the location
result = location_chain_lcel.invoke({"location": "China"})

# Print the result (the recommended classic dish from China)
print(result)


# #### **Simple sequential chain**
# 

# Sequential chains allow you to use output of one LLM as the input for another LLM. This approach is beneficial for dividing tasks and maintaining the focus of your LLM.
# 
# In this example, you see a sequence that:
# 
# - Gets a meal from a location
# - Gets a recipe for that meal
# - Estimates the cooking time for that recipe
# 
# This pattern is incredibly valuable for breaking down complex tasks into logical steps, where each step depends on the output of the previous step. The traditional approach uses `SequentialChain`, while the modern `LCEL` approach uses piping and `RunnablePassthrough.assign`.
# 
# 
# #### Traditional Approach: `SequentialChain`
# 

# In[68]:


# Import SequentialChain from langchain.chains module
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain

# Create a template for generating a recipe based on a meal
template = """Given a meal {meal}, give a short and simple recipe on how to make that dish at home.
 YOUR RESPONSE:
"""

# Create a PromptTemplate with 'meal' as the input variable
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=['meal'])

# Create an LLMChain (chain 2) for generating recipes
# The output_key='recipe' defines how this chain's output will be referenced in later chains
dish_chain = LLMChain(llm=llama_llm, prompt=prompt_template, output_key='recipe')


# In[69]:


# Create a template for estimating cooking time based on a recipe
# This template asks the LLM to analyze a recipe and estimate preparation time
template = """Given the recipe {recipe}, estimate how much time I need to cook it.
 YOUR RESPONSE:
"""

# Create a PromptTemplate with 'recipe' as the input variable
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=['recipe'])

# Create an LLMChain (chain 3) for estimating cooking time
# The output_key='time' defines the key for this chain's output in the final result
recipe_chain = LLMChain(llm=llama_llm, prompt=prompt_template, output_key='time')


# In[70]:


# Create a SequentialChain that combines all three chains:
# 1. location_chain (from earlier code): Takes a location and suggests a dish
# 2. dish_chain: Takes the suggested dish and provides a recipe
# 3. recipe_chain: Takes the recipe and estimates cooking time
overall_chain = SequentialChain(
    # List of chains to execute in sequence
    chains=[location_chain, dish_chain, recipe_chain],
    
    # The input variables required to start the chain sequence
    # Only 'location' is needed to begin the process
    input_variables=['location'],
    
    # The output variables to include in the final result
    # This makes the output of each chain available in the final result
    output_variables=['meal', 'recipe', 'time'],
    
    # Whether to print detailed information about each step
    verbose=True
)


# Let's use ```pprint``` to print the response to make it more clear.
# 

# In[71]:


from pprint import pprint
pprint(overall_chain.invoke(input={'location':'China'}))


# #### Modern Approach: LCEL 
# 
# Here is the same sequential chain implemented using the modern LCEL approach:
# 

# In[72]:


from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

# ### Tools and Agents
# 

# ##### **Tools**
# 

# Tools extend an LLM's capabilities beyond just generating text. They allow the model to actually perform actions in the world or access external systems. This notebook shows the Python REPL tool, but there are many other tools:
# 
# - Search tools: Connect to search engines, database queries, or vector stores.
# - API tools: Make calls to external web services.
# - Human-in-the-loop tools: Request human input for critical decisions.
# 

# You can find a list of tools that LangChain supports at [https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#tools).
# 

# Let’s explore how to work with tools, using the `Python REPL` tool as an example. The `Python REPL` tool can run Python commands. These commands can either come from the user or the LLM can generate the commands. This tool is particularly useful for complex calculations. Instead of having the LLM generate the answer directly, using the LLM to generate code to calculate the answer is more efficient.
# 

# In[ ]:


from langchain_core.tools import Tool
from langchain.tools import tool
from langchain_experimental.utilities import PythonREPL


# The `@tool` decorator is a convenient way to define tools, but you can also use the Tool class directly:
# 

# In[ ]:


# Create a PythonREPL instance
# This provides an environment where Python code can be executed as strings
python_repl = PythonREPL()

# Create a Tool using the Tool class
# This wraps the Python REPL functionality as a tool that can be used by agents
python_calculator = Tool(
    # The name of the tool - this helps agents identify when to use this tool
    name="Python Calculator",
    
    # The function that will be called when the tool is used
    # python_repl.run takes a string of Python code and executes it
    func=python_repl.run,
    
    # A description of what the tool does and how to use it
    # This helps the agent understand when and how to use this tool
    description="Useful for when you need to perform calculations or execute Python code. Input should be valid Python code."
)


# Let's test this tool with a simple Python command:
# 

# In[ ]:


python_calculator.invoke("a = 3; b = 1; print(a+b)")


# We can also create custom tools using the `@tool` decorator:
# 

# In[ ]:


@tool
def search_weather(location: str):
    """Search for the current weather in the specified location."""
    # In a real application, this would call a weather API
    return f"The weather in {location} is currently sunny and 72°F."


# ##### **Toolkits**
# 

# Toolkits are collections of tools that are designed to be used together for specific tasks.
# 
# Let's create a simple toolkit that contains multiple tools:
# 

# In[ ]:


# Create a toolkit (collection of tools)
tools = [python_calculator, search_weather]


# A list of toolkits that Langchain supports is available at [https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tools/#toolkits](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tools/#toolkits).
# 

# ##### **Agents**
# 

# By themselves, language models can't take actions; they just output text. A big use case for LangChain is creating agents. Agents are systems that leverage a large language model (LLM) as a reasoning engine to identify appropriate actions and determine the required inputs for those actions. The results of those actions are to be fed back into the agent. The agent then makes a determination whether more actions are needed, or if the task is complete.
# 

# The modern approach to creating agents in LangChain uses the `create_react_agent` function and `AgentExecutor`:
# 

# In[ ]:


from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain.agents import create_react_agent, AgentExecutor
from langchain_core.tools import Tool


# First, you will create a prompt for the agent:
# 

# In[ ]:


# Create the ReAct agent prompt template
# The ReAct prompt needs to instruct the model to follow the thought-action-observation pattern
prompt_template = """You are an agent who has access to the following tools:

{tools}

The available tools are: {tool_names}

To use a tool, please use the following format:
```
Thought: I need to figure out what to do
Action: tool_name
Action Input: the input to the tool
```

After you use a tool, the observation will be provided to you:
```
Observation: result of the tool
```

Then you should continue with the thought-action-observation cycle until you have enough information to respond to the user's request directly.
When you have the final answer, respond in this format:
```
Thought: I know the answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original query
```

Remember, when using the Python Calculator tool, the input must be valid Python code.

Begin!

Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}
"""

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)


# Now, you will create the agent and executor:
# 

# In[ ]:


# Create the agent
agent = create_react_agent(
    llm=llama_llm,
    tools=tools,
    prompt=prompt
)


# The `create_react_agent` function creates an agent that follows the Reasoning + Acting (ReAct) framework. This framework was introduced in a [2023 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) and has become one of the most effective approaches for LLM-based agents.
# 
# **Key aspects of `create_react_agent`:**
# 
# **Input Parameters**:
# 
# - llm: The language model that powers the agent's reasoning. This is the "brain" that decides what to do.
# - tools: The list of tools the agent can use to interact with the world.
# - prompt: The instructions that guide the agent's behavior and explain the tools.
# 
# 
# **How ReAct Works**:
# The ReAct framework follows a specific cycle:
# 
# - Reasoning: The agent thinks about the problem and plans its approach
# - Action: It selects a tool and formulates the input
# - Observation: It receives the result of the tool execution
# - Repeat: It reasons about the observation and decides the next step
# 
# 
# **Output Format Control**:
# The ReAct agent must produce output in a structured format that includes:
# 
# - Thought: The agent's reasoning process
# - Action: The tool to use
# - Action Input: The input to the tool
# - Observation: The result of the tool execution
# - Final Answer: The final response when the agent has solved the problem
#

# Create the agent executor
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent, 
    tools=tools, 
    verbose=True,
    handle_parsing_errors=True
)


# The `AgentExecutor` is a crucial component that manages the execution flow of the agent. This component handles the orchestration between the agent's reasoning and the actual tool execution.
# 
# **Key responsibilities of `AgentExecutor`:**
# 
# **Execution Loop Management**:
# 
# - Sends the initial query to the agent
# - Parses the agent's response to identify tool calls
# - Executes the specified tools with the provided inputs
# - Feeds tool results back to the agent
# - Continues this loop until the agent reaches a final answer
# 
# **Input Parameters**:
# 
# - agent: The agent object created with create_react_agent
# - tools: The same list of tools provided to the agent
# - verbose: When set to True, displays the entire thought process, which is extremely helpful for debugging
# 
# **Error Handling**:
# 
# - Catches and manages errors that occur during tool execution
# - Can be configured with handle_parsing_errors=True to recover from agent output format errors
# - Can implement retry logic for failed tool executions
# 
# **Memory and State**:
# 
# - Maintain the conversation state across multiple steps
# - Can configure with different types of memory for storing conversation history
# 
# **Early Stopping**:
# 
# - Can enforce maximum iterations to prevent infinite loops
# - Implements timeouts to handle tool executions that take too long
# 
# Let's test the agent with a simple problem that requires only one tool:
# 

# In[ ]:


# Ask the agent a question that requires only calculation
result = agent_executor.invoke({"input": "What is the square root of 256?"})
print(result["output"])


# ---
# 
# Next, let's test the agent with different types of queries that would require it to use different tools from the toolkit:
# 

# In[ ]:


# Examples of different types of queries to test the agent
queries = [
    "What's 345 * 789?",
    "Calculate the square root of 144",
    "What's the weather in Miami?",
    "If it's sunny in Chicago, what would be a good outdoor activity?",
    "Generate a list of prime numbers below 50 and calculate their sum"
]

for query in queries:
    print(f"\n{'='*60}")
    print(f"QUERY: {query}")
    print(f"{'='*60}")
    
    result = agent_executor.invoke({"input": query})
    
    print(f"\nFINAL ANSWER: {result['output']}")


# ---
# 
# As you can see, when faced with different queries, the ReAct agent follows a consistent yet adaptable thought process. 
# 
# For mathematical questions like "Calculate the square root of 144," the agent recognizes the need for computation and selects the Python Calculator tool, writing code to calculate the answer. 
# 
# With weather-related queries like "What's the weather in Miami?", the agent immediately identifies the Weather Search tool as appropriate.
# 
# At each step, the agent maintains a "thought-action-observation" cycle, explicitly reasoning about which tool to use, executing the chosen tool with appropriate input, observing the result, and continuing this process until the agent has all the information needed to provide a comprehensive final answer.

# ### Exercise 7
# #### **Creating Your First LangChain Agent with Basic Tools**
# 
# In this exercise, you'll build a simple agent that can help users with basic tasks using two custom tools. This exercise is a perfect starting point for understanding how LangChain agents work.
# 
# **Instructions:**
# 
# 1. Create two simple tools: A calculator and a text formatter.
# 2. Set up a basic agent that can use these tools.
# 3. Test the agent with straightforward questions.
# 
# **Starter code: provide your solution in the TODO parts**
